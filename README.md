# OST - Open Source Thinking

Recently I discovered the practice of "active externalization", which is simply writing down everything instead of trying to remember it all (internalization). I think that this note taking system will be amazingly helpful with Certificate 4, so I'm open sourcing my "Obsidian Vault". This way anyone and everyone can access all the notes I take, and can contribute as well!

# How to use

As you may have noticed, all the files here are markdown format files. If its your style, you can read through them in any Code Editor. However, these have originally be written for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). Simply download this project, and open it as an obisidan vault!

Opening in an obisidan vault will be the ideal way to read these files. In the top couple lines of each document, you'll find some very helpful information. For example, each file will contain a tag, like #ICTNWK401, which will link it to the tasks that it is relevant to. 
Obsidian also has very nice local link formatting, although I'm sure these work in IDE's as well.

# Contributing

I've never had any real rules around contributing. If you'd like to contribute, just create your own fork of this project, add your notes or corrections and **make a pull request**! Please also tag the pull request with either #Fix or #Addition so I know what to look for, as well as a brief summary of the request. Thanks a ton, hope to see everyone pass this semester :)
