# OST - Open Source Thinking

Recently I discovered the practice of "active externalization", which is simply writing down everything instead of trying to remember it all (internalization). I think that this note taking system will be amazingly helpful with Certificate 4, so I'm open sourcing my "Obsidian Vault". This way anyone and everyone can access all the notes I take, and can contribute as well! 

Update (6-12-23): Hello future Cert IV's and or stalkers! I'm unlikely to ever update this documentation, as its pretty high level how to stuff that I don't really look at ever. I will review PRs and other contribs tho! A lot of this is still pretty good for the Cert IV in ICT (Network Specialisation) Course, and for that I'll leave it public.

# How to use

As you may have noticed, all the files here are markdown format files. If its your style, you can read through them in any Code Editor. However, these have originally be written for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). Simply download this project, and open it as an obisidan vault!

Opening in an obisidan vault will be the ideal way to read these files. In the top couple lines of each document, you'll find some very helpful information. For example, each file will contain a tag, like #ICTNWK401, which will link it to the tasks that it is relevant to. 
Obsidian also has very nice local link formatting, although I'm sure these work in IDE's as well.

I recommend using Github Desktop as well, to keep up to date with updates using the rebase tool.
