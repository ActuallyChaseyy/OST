Type 2 hypervisors are software running on another OS to host their virtual machines. 

Generally, type 2 is slower than [Type 1](Type%201%20virtual%20machines.md), however this is dependent on the available resources. It is also less stable for guests, due to the other applications that run on the host. 
In some scenarios, a vulnerability in the host can affect the guests and vice versa.
