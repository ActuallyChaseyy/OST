Type 2 hypervisors are software running on another OS to host their virtual machines. 

Generally, type 2 is slower than type 1, however this is dependent on the available resources. It is also less stable for guests, due to the other applications that run on the host. 
In some scenarios, a vulnerability in the host can affect the guests and vice versa.
